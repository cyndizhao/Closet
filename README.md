# Stylite
### A Platform To Share Outfits And Styles
Stylite is a web application that allows fashion-forward users to share their
outfits with the world. Users are able to upload photos, catalogue items with
a description and link to buy, follow other users, and search for outfits based
on a variety of unique tags. In addition, brands are able to create special
corporate accounts to show off their latest collections.

**The backend used Postgres, Ruby on Rails and SQL, while the front end utilized
Bootstrap, jQuery, AJAX, CSS, and HTML.**
